# mazebot

to be merged into imalolnoob/management-bot

to run:

install pillow with pip or package manager or smth

python3 maze.py generates maze.png in current directory

python3 mazebot.py starts a discord bot that accepts maze commands

run from inside directory please so filepaths work

put bot token in maze-bot/bot_token

thanks stigl for original idea and source code (which i converted into python)
